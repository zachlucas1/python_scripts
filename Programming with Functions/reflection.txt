Please take a few minutes to reflect on your experience in CSE 111 and
think about the challenges, successes, and all that you've learned
along the way.


Now, please respond thoroughly (1 - 2 paragraphs for each question) to
the following questions.

1. Describe an experience you had this semester where you saw the power of
functions.

When we first learned functions I honestly had no idea what the point of 
them were. You could easily make a program without functions. But the more
we used them and made them part of our code, the more I understood. One instance
was during the program we were making an image with tkinter. If there werent functions
it wouldnt work but also it would be insanely cluttered and hard to read.


2. In your judgment, what is the value of test functions?

Test functions are very valuable no matter what you are coding. They are essentially
there to solve issues that might arise. They make your code seamless and bullet
proof to whatever you throw at it. They are especially necessary when you are creating
more of an important program that calculates. It would be a shame to use calculations 
for something important while getting incorrect readings from the code. 


3. Describe your process for troubleshooting and fixing a program that
has a problem. What is one thing you can do to improve your process?

I had an instance of troubleshooting my insulin calculator program. I was testing it
and I was getting incorrect numbers. It took me a while to figure it out and I could not
for the life of me get it figured out. I then broke up the function into pieces to pinpoint
the issue. It turned out I had my times all wrong. I made a slight adjustment and it worked
fine. I can improve my process by probably using pytest more and also writing it correctly the
first time so that there are less issues.
